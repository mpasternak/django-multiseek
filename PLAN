Extensibility:
 * themes?
    - date field COULD be themeable
    - jquery-ui OR foundation4, for example
    - use (for example) foundation4 for all elements
 * extensibility:
    - my own field types (including JS) in my project


Bug?
1) is the input json sanitized properly?

Would be nice to have:
2) nicer alerts for saving/loading forms OR be able to plug your own yes/no
    modal dialogs

Perhaps someday:
3) embed multiseek in admin
4) multiseek.create_registry could autodiscover fields basing on model
